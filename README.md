Crash Bandicoot 4 for Web Browser or Online Play

Creating a way for Crash Bandicoot 4 to be played from the browser.

First step is to aqurire the game files and have it uploaded here to git. We are going to need to utilize Git Large File Storage (LFS) for the job.

To make a game playable in a web browser using WebAssembly and Emscripten, one would typically need the following requirements:

**Emscripten SDK**: 
Ensure you have the Emscripten SDK installed. It is used to compile C/C++ code into WebAssembly.

**Codebase**:
The game's source code, usually in C/C++.

**Game Assets**:
All the necessary assets (textures, sounds, models, etc.) that the game uses.

**HTML and JavaScript**: 
A basic HTML file to embed the WebAssembly binary and JavaScript to handle interactions between the game and the browser.

**WebAssembly Module**: 
The compiled WebAssembly binary generated by Emscripten from your gameâ€™s source code.

**Web Server**: 
A web server to host the game files for testing and deployment.

Additionally, you might need:

**Emscripten Ports**: Precompiled libraries and tools provided by Emscripten for common functionalities like SDL, OpenGL, etc.
**Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the web browser supports WebAssembly and any other required technologies.
Ensure you have all dependencies managed and correctly configured to compile and run the game in a web browser efficiently.

As for web hosting, it is possible to host a website directly from a GitHub repository using GitHub Pages. Here are the steps to set it up:

1. **Create a GitHub Pages Branch:**
   - Create a branch named `gh-pages` in your repository (given those that forked this). This branch will contain the files that GitHub Pages will serve.

2. **Move Build Files:**
   - Move the compiled WebAssembly files, HTML, JavaScript, and any other necessary assets to the `gh-pages` branch.

3. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to the repository settings.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Select `gh-pages` as the source branch.
   - Save the settings.

4. **Access the Website:**
   - Your website will be accessible at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

This way, GitHub Pages will host the WebAssembly game directly from the repository.
